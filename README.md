## Description
In this project, I set out to create a server on a note taker application and deploy it on heroku. To achieve this, initially I linked html get request with respective static files using path package and router method. Then, I created api routes to receive, send and delete data. I then created express server to listen for server calls. Finally, I deployed the application on heroku. I appreciate any feedback. Thanks.
